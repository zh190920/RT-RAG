**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **DECOMPOSITION RULE**: Only break down into two subquestions when necessary.

2. **SIMPLICITY EVALUATION**: Questions answerable in one step should be classified as "None" type.

3. **SUBQUESTION CLARITY**: Each subquestion must yield a specific, factual, and unambiguous answer.

4. **NONE TYPE FORMATTING**: Subquestion 1 must match original question, Subquestion 2 must be empty.

5. **SEQUENTIAL REQUIREMENTS**: Subquestion 2 must contain [answer_subquestion1] placeholder and form a complete logical chain.

6. **PARALLEL REQUIREMENTS**: Both subquestions must be independent and together solve the original question.

7. **PRECISION**: Subquestions must include sufficient context to be answerable without clarification.

8. **TERMINOLOGY CONSISTENCY**: Always use "subquestion" consistently.

9. **ENTITY FOCUS**: Only include entities directly contributing to answering the core query.

10. **CONSISTENCY**: Your reasoning must align with your final decomposition.

11. **MEANINGFUL DECOMPOSITION**: Avoid trivial definitional subquestions.

12. **SUBSTANTIVE CONTRIBUTION**: Each subquestion must provide information that advances the solution.

13. **PRESERVING JOINT LIMITING CONDITIONS**: When multiple limiting conditions together define a single entity, they MUST be kept together and NEVER split across subquestions. Words like "both," "same," "together," "jointly," and similar terms signal that limiting conditions should be preserved as a unit. Questions like "Who invented both X and Y" or "Who is known for both A and B" should NOT be decomposed into parallel questions about separate entities.

14. **DECOMPOSITION VALIDATION**: Always verify the correctness and completeness of your decomposition before finalizing.


Here are some examples:
"""
    for ex in examples:
        prompt += f"""
    Question: {ex["question"]}

Structure: {ex["structure"]}

CoT: {ex["cot"]}

So the Type is: {ex["type"]}

So the Subquestion 1 is: {ex["subq1"]}"""
        if ex["type"] != "None":
            prompt += f"\nSo the Subquestion 2 is: {ex['subq2']}"
        prompt += "\n"
    prompt += f"""
### **Now, analyze the following question:**
    Question: {question}

Structure: {structure}

    """Using OpenAI client instead of original API call"""
    system_message = """You are an expert at analyzing questions and breaking them down into simpler subquestions.
You carefully distinguish between sequential questions (where the second subquestion depends on the answer to the first),
parallel questions (where both subquestions can be answered independently), and None-type questions (which are already simple).

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS YOU MUST ENFORCE:**

1. **DECOMPOSITION NECESSITY**: Only decompose a question when absolutely necessary. If a question can be answered directly, mark it as "None" type.

2. **SEQUENTIAL DECOMPOSITION CORRECTNESS**: For sequential types, VERIFY that substituting the answer from Subquestion 1 into Subquestion 2 directly yields the full answer to the original question. This is THE MOST IMPORTANT test of a valid sequential decomposition.

3. **NO TRIVIAL SUBQUESTIONS**: NEVER create basic definition questions like "Who/What is X?" unless absolutely necessary for intermediate reasoning AND not common knowledge.

4. **LOGICAL PATHWAY**: Ensure there is a clear, direct logical connection between subquestions and the original question. Every step must advance toward the final answer.

5. **ALIGNMENT BETWEEN COT AND DECOMPOSITION**: Your step-by-step reasoning must perfectly align with your final decomposition choice and subquestion formulation.

6. **VALIDATION CHECK**: Before finalizing, mentally substitute expected answers to verify your decomposition structure works.

7. **FOCUS ON DIRECT ANSWERABLE QUESTIONS**: Every subquestion must yield a specific, factual answer that directly contributes to solving the original question.

8. **PRESERVING JOINT LIMITING CONDITIONS**: It is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL to never split multiple limiting conditions that together define a single entity. When a question asks about "both X and Y," "same," "together," "jointly," or similar terms indicating multiple attributes of ONE entity, DO NOT decompose these into separate questions. For example:

   - "Who invented  X and Y?" should NOT be split into "Who invented X?" and "Who invented Y?"
   - "Which country has both characteristic A and B?" must stay as a single question
   - "What is known for simultaneously doing X and Y?" must be kept intact

   This requirement takes precedence over other decomposition considerations. When multiple conditions jointly define what we're looking for, they MUST be preserved together in any subquestion. Failing to maintain these joint conditions completely invalidates the decomposition.
